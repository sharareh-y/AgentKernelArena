    Optimize the Triton kernel `_apply_write_kernel` for maximum GPU throughput
    while maintaining correctness.

    The kernel applies staged writes to a 2D output tensor. Each program (one per write)
    copies a variable-length segment from a flat write_contents buffer into a specific
    row and column offset of the output tensor. Cumulative lengths (write_cu_lens) define
    the boundaries within write_contents for each write operation.

    Key optimization opportunities:
    - Block size tuning for different content lengths
    - Vectorized loads/stores
    - Memory coalescing

    Constraints:
    - Must maintain the same function signature for `apply_write`
    - Output must match reference exactly
