    Optimize the Triton mean reduction kernel `mean_kernel` for maximum
    GPU throughput while maintaining numerical correctness.

    The kernel computes the mean along a single dimension by viewing the input as (M, N, K)
    where N is the reduction dimension, with each program computing one output element.

    Key optimization opportunities:
    - Block size tuning for different reduction sizes
    - Parallel reduction strategies
    - Memory access coalescing

    Constraints:
    - Must maintain the same function signature for `mean_dim`
    - Output must match reference within atol=1e-2, rtol=1e-2 for float16
