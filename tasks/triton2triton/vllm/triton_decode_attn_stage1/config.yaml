    Optimize the Triton decode attention stage1 kernel `_fwd_kernel_stage1` for
    maximum GPU throughput while maintaining numerical correctness.

    The kernel implements the first stage of split-KV decode attention. Each program
    instance handles one (batch, head, kv_split) and computes partial attention
    over a contiguous range of KV tokens from a paged KV cache:
    - Loads Q vector for current (batch, head)
    - Iterates over KV tokens in the assigned split, loading K/V via paged
      Req_to_tokens mapping
    - Computes Q @ K^T scaled dot-product with online softmax
    - Outputs partial attention output and logsumexp for later reduction

    Key optimization opportunities:
    - BLOCK_N tuning for the target GPU
    - Memory access coalescing for paged KV cache reads
    - Warp scheduling and occupancy tuning (num_warps, num_stages)
    - Reducing masking overhead
    - Loop unrolling

    Constraints:
    - Must maintain the same function signature for `decode_att_m_fwd`
    - Output must match reference within atol=1e-2, rtol=1e-2 for float16
    - Must handle arbitrary sequence lengths, head dimensions, and page sizes
