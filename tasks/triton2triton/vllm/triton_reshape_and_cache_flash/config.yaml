    Optimize the Triton kernel `reshape_and_cache_kernel_flash` for maximum GPU
    throughput while maintaining numerical correctness.

    The kernel scatters K/V tokens into paged KV-cache slots. Each token's key and
    value vectors are written to the appropriate block and slot in the paged cache
    based on a slot_mapping tensor.

    Key optimization opportunities:
    - Tile size tuning for the target GPU
    - Memory access coalescing for scattered writes
    - Warp scheduling and occupancy tuning

    Constraints:
    - Must maintain the same function signature for `reshape_and_cache_flash`
    - Output must match reference (exact copy for auto dtype)
  cheatsheet: null
